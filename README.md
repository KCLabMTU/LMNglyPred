# LMNglyPred
LMNglyPred: Prediction of Human N-Linked Glycosylation Site using embeddings from pre-trained protein language model

## Evaluate Model
Programs were executed using anaconda version: 2020.07, recommended to install the same

The programs were developed in the following environment. python : 3.8.3.final.0, python-bits : 64, OS : Linux, OS-release : 5.8.0-38-generic, machine : x86_64, processor : x86_64, pandas : 1.0.5, numpy : 1.18.5, pip : 20.1.1, scipy : 1.4.1, scikit-learn : 0.23.1., keras : 2.4.3, tensorflow : 2.3.1.

1. Please place the Glycobiology LMNglyPred DeepNGlyPred Dataset.ipynb, Independent_Test_Set_Prot_T5_feature_Aug_12.txt, LMNglyPred4752.h5, NGLYDE LMNnglydePred Glycobiology.ipynb, LMNnglydePred965.h5  in the same directory where you will execute the python program.

2. Run the Glycobiology LMNglyPred DeepNGlyPred Dataset.ipynb, and NGLYDE LMNnglydePred Glycobiology.ipynb to obtain reported results.

*** For your convenience we have uploaded the ProtT5 feature extraction program (analyze.py) for the protein sequence from ProtT5 as well as corresponding 1024 feature vector extraction program (DeepNGlyPred Prot_T5 feature extraction program.ipynb) from the ProtT5 file. ***

If you need any futher help please contact Dr. Dukka B. KC at dbkc@mtu.edu.
